# MincraftModManager (MCMM)
Playing Minecraft with mods is all fun but as soon as you have to switch out your mods when you want to play on another version or with different mods it gets tedious. The MinecraftModManager allows for the creation of different mod goups. Each goup holds a list of mods that can be enabled or disabled depending on your situation. Quickly load a mod preset and jump back into the game.
